_This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow._
Hi! My name is Trinity Ten (Trinidad Diez), I'm argentinian and I'm 18 years old. 
I don't know how to code. I'm teaching myself (actually BroCode, CodeAdademy and FreeCodeCamp are teaching me).
I'm sure one day I'm going to be a decent programmer, I just need to work on it.
I've just joined GitHub (my teacher didn't come to school and I had a free hour).

I love movies (fav = Fight Club), anime (fav = Cyberpunk 2077: Edgerunners), books (fav = The Picture of Dorian Gray) and music (SOAD, AIC, RATM, STP, RHCP, Pantera (I'm really happy because I'm going to a Pantera concert with my dad and my uncle on July), Metallica, Deftones, Smashing Pumpkins, Korn, Slipknot...) I also try to play guitar but I'm really mediocre.

I have a dog. Her name is Aurelia. She is the best dog in the cosmos.

I don't know what else to say...
hope you're doing fine.
Thanks for reading <3

I don't know how one closes mails/letters/whatever in English,
Trinity.
